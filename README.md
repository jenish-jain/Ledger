# improvements
[] differentiate between trasactions of income vs credit and expense vs debt clear( or accordingly)
[] we should be able to project actual income vs total income including credit  and actual expense vs totla exponse including debut
[] credit is not as god as actual income based on promise there should be a healthy score which should dipict these accordingly
    more actual income better the score / credit should have a lower weight in that
[] same goes for debt debt weight in exponse will be higher than expense as debut can come with interest
[] productivity rate if can be displayed should be incorporated
